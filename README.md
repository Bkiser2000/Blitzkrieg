# Blitzkrieg
A new programming language built on Python, Blitzkrieg is my interpretation of Python that I intend to design for speed and simplicity. It combines the readability of Python with aggressive compiler optimizations, JIT compilation, and a custom virtual machine to deliver superior performance for mathematical computations and algorithmic tasks.
